## Workers
A worker is an elected position that gets paid via dilution to fund new blockchain infrastructure.  Their employment “smart contract” specifies a start date, an end date, a daily pay rate, and a vesting period. (TODO: i would expand on this. how much do they get paid (% wise) each day vs. how much vests. if collecting early, what's the penalty. etc.)   They get paid each day between the start and end date that a worker is voted high enough in the approval queue to get funding.  Their pay vests linearly from the time they receive it until the end of the vesting period.

Each worker can receive positive and negative approval.    This means that to get funded a worker must have a lot of positive support and minimal negative approval.  It also means that they can get fired very quickly by having a vote switch from being for to being against.
