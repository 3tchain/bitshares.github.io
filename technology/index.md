# Technology

The world of commerce is moving faster than ever, but not all businesses can keep up.
Many modern financial tools can be too costly, clunky, or unreliable for today's businesses.
Poor tools lead to missed opportunities, and missed opportunities don't lead to progress.

**BitShares** is leveling the playing field. We are empowering businesses with financial tools reaching
new levels of efficiency, usability, and transparency.

Our platform puts the power of self-enforcing financial contracts into the hands of businesses and individuals, and it's ready today.

Self-enforcing contracts--commonly known as **smart contracts**--are computer protocols that help facilitate financial transactions just like normal
financial contracts, but with one important difference: they are automated!

*insert example here?*

Compared to the settlement of normal financial contracts, this type of automation provides the following benefits:

- Smart contracts aim to provide security superior to traditional contract law and to reduce other transaction costs associated with contracting
- lowering costs
- level playing field
- predictability
- transparency
- reliability
- ease of use
- profitable new business models

The BitShares platform itself is run and maintained by the **BitShares community**--an open consortium of individuals and organizations committed to providing universal access to the power of smart contracts.

Working together, this community has designed and developed the BitShares platform to include numerous innovative features which are not found elsewhere within the smart contract industry:

#### <a href="/technology/performance-and-scalability.html">Performance and Scalability</a>
BitShares can process over 10 thousand transactions per second and transactions clear in less than 10 seconds. It can also scale to more than 10 million user accounts.

#### <a href="/technology/referral-rewards.html">Referral Rewards</a>
BitShares is the first blockchain with a built in referral system designed to promote viral growth. Sign up a friend and collect 80% of their future transaction fees.
Traditional payment companies expect to generate over $100 per user on average and many companies are willing to pay over $40 per user even without a clear monetization strategy.
BitShares passes the vast majority of that revenue on to its members who sign up new users.

#### <a href="/technology/price-stable-cryptocurrencies.html">Price-Stable Cryptocurrencies</a>
BitAssets were first introduced by BitShares in July 2014 as stable digital currencies with minimal counter party risk.  Under BitShares BitAssets receive a significant upgrade with guaranteed minimal liquidity, user created and customized BitAssets, and BitAssets backed by other BitAssets.

BitAssets are the core feature of BitShares and represent a stable crypto-currency with minimal counterparty risk.  With BitShares, BitAssets receive a significant upgrade with many more advanced and tunable parameters.
Perhaps most importantly, there is no longer any pre-determined expiration on shorts and longs can now request force settlement at the price feed after a reasonable waiting period.  Under this system, BitAssets are assured to be worth *AT LEAST* their face value and perhaps more if there is little demand for shorting.

#### <a href="/technology/customizable-account-permissions.html">Customizable Account Permissions</a>
A user-centric design greatly enhances usability and security over the key-centric approaches taken by other blockchain technologies.
This means that a company account can require approval of its board of directors and each board member may in turn require 2 factor authentication.
The result is a new concept which we call hierarchical threshold multi-sig.
With corporate accounts board members can change their personal keys without having to change the permissions associated with the company.
Permissions can be nested arbitrarily deep with funds being jointly managed by several companies each of which is managed by their own board each member of which utilizes 2 factor authentication while all accounts have a cold-storage backup key.

#### <a href="/technology/transaction-proposals.html">Transaction Proposals</a>
Propose a transaction and allow the blockchain to gather the signatures requested and automatically execute the transaction at the appointed time. This feature works hand-in-hand with corporate accounts and makes it easy for everyone to approve or reject transactions. Multi-sig done right.

#### <a href="/technology/custom-assets-with-identity-management.html">Custom Assets with Identity Management</a>
The New York Stock exchange is a company that maintains a ledger to track ownership of stock and debt issued by other companies. It earns money from transaction fees and has its own stock as well.   Like the New York Stock exchange, BitShares allows people to issue their stock or debt to be tracked and traded on its distributed ledger.
BitShares accounts can be tagged by other accounts to indicate who knows who. This web of trust can be used by asset issuers to remain compliant with relevant regulations by restricting their securities to authorized individuals

#### <a href="/technology/decentralized-asset-exchange.html">Decentralized Asset Exchange</a>
BitShares provides the highest performance decentralized exchange available that has all of the features you would expect in a trading platform. Orders are settled the second you submit them. Collateralized bonds provide opportunities for leverage and earning interest and options contracts allow you to hedge your position.

#### <a href="/technology/delegated-proof-of-stake-consensus.html">Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus</a>
The BitShares platform is implemented using a public **blockchain** utilizing the innovative
**Delegated Proof-of-Stake** distributed consensus protocol.

#### <a href="/technology/stakeholder-approved-project-funding.html">Stakeholder-Approved Project Funding</a>
Proper pricing is important for to ensure a sustainable business model. By charging fees that are appropriate and distributing the income in an effective manner BitShares powered networks can grow while while others struggle. Members pay fees similar to Bitcoin ($0.04) while users pay fees similar to Dwolla ($0.20) or centralized exchanges (0.2%).

- In addition to performance, the built in fee structure and revenue sharing incentive structure should motivate adoption far more effectively than any other blockchain.
