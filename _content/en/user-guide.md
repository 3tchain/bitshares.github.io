## Membership Structure

Under DPOS stakeholders elect individuals to produce blocks, configure blockchain parameters, and fund infrastructure.  Under DPOS 2.0 the roles of delegates and users have been divided into several different roles.

1. **Customers** use the services provided by the blockchain and pay full transaction fees.  These users have no role in the governance of the network.
2. **Members** are paid-for premium accounts which can use their stake to vote for elected positions.  Members get an 80% discount on transaction fees and are qualified to receive referral income from new users they sign up.
3. **Witnesses** are an elected position that produce blocks and validate transactions.  They are paid a small percentage of transaction fees necessary to cover the cost of running the network.
4. **Committee Members** are elected positions that have the power to propose changes to the blockchain parameters.  This position is not paid.
5. **Infrastructure Members** are paid by the blockchain to perform needed development.  All infrastructure spending must be directly approved by the voting Members and has a hard-coded spending limit.
