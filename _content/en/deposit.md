There are many ways to move funds into or out of the BitShares ecosystem.

## Bridges/Gateways

Bridges/gateways are the recommended method of moving funds into or out of the network.
They simplify the process of moving funds from one blockchain-based crypto currency to another.
For instance, you can buy bitUSD with Bitcoin at (close to) market rates quickly.

Most crypto-currency exchanges offer a wide variety of different crypto currency pairs and in
contrast to bridges not only allow for instant trades at market price, but also offer to put a
buy/sell order at a desired price.
