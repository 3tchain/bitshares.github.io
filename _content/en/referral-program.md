Earn $80 or more for every lifetime member you sign up.

BitShares has several different kinds of accounts: users, subscribers, and lifetime members.  

**User accounts** are free, but do not qualify for the referral program, nor any cash back on transaction fees.  

**Annual subscriptions** cost $20/year and earn 50% cash back on every fee they pay. They also qualify for up to 50% of the fees paid by anyone they refer to the network until their subscription expires.  

**Lifetime memberships** cost $100 and earn 80% cash back on every fee they pay. They also qualify for 80% of the fees paid by those they refer to the network.  Additionally, they qualify for 30% of every fee paid by subscribers they have referred and any other non-member account below the subscribers.  In the event of a subscription expiration, the referral income falls back to the nearest lifetime member in the referral history.   

These referral cashback rates, 50% and 80%, can be adjusted by the consensus of the BitShares stakeholders at any time.  Annual subscribers have their rates locked in for one year, while lifetime members have their rates locked in for life.   

We estimate that the average fees paid over the lifetime of each user will be in excess of $100<sup>1</sup>, which means that a membership could earn over $80 per referred user. Of course, it is your own responsibility to estimate how often you, and those you refer, will use the network. Keep in mind that the BitShares stakeholders have the ability to change transaction fees, which could impact future earnings. 

# Examples

When an user account pays $20 to subscribe, the $10 is paid to their referrer, $6 is paid to the nearest lifetime member, and $4 is paid to the network.  The account becomes its own referrer for one year.  In one year, the renewal fee divided in a similar manner to the original subscription.  

When an user account pays $100 to become a lifetime member, $50 is paid to their referrer, $30 is paid to the nearest lifetime member, and $20 is paid to the network.   After this point the account becomes its own referrer and nearest lifetime member and its prior referrers no longer get any revenue from this user. 

If an accountâ€™s referrer is a subscriber whose subscription has expired, then the referrer fee goes to the nearest lifetime member.   

If a subscriber decides to upgrade to a lifetime member then $50 goes to his referrer, $30 to the nearest lifetime member and $20 goes to the network.  Subscribers do not qualify for a 50% cash back on the upgrade fee.
