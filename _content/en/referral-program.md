# Referral Program

BitShares is the first blockchain with a built in referral system designed to promote viral growth.
Sign up a friend and collect 80% of their future transaction fees.
Traditional payment companies expect to generate over $100 per user on average and many companies are
willing to pay over $40 per user even without a clear monetization strategy.
BitShares passes the vast majority of that revenue on to its members who sign up new users.

When you join BitShares as a lifetime member you get many benefits.  Among these benefits are 80% cash back on all
transaction fees, bulk discounts, and an opportunity to collect 80% of the fees paid by every user you sign up.  We estimate
that the average fees paid over the lifetime of each user will be in excess of $100<sup>1</sup> which means you could
earn over $80 per user.  The cost to join BitShares as a lifetime Member is just $100 which should easily
pay for itself through cashback and referral rewards.

### How it Works

Every new account must be created by an existing account. This is a restriction enforced by the
fact that account registration charges a transaction fee which requires an existing account to
pay. The person who pays this transaction fee is known as the registrar. Generally speaking, the
registrar is likely to be the wallet provider. If the registrar is a paid lifetime member then
they have permission to divide the referral income between themselves and an optional referrer.
If the registrar is not a paid lifetime member, the new account will inherit the referral
allocation of the registrar's account. At any time, an account can upgrade to a paid lifetime
member for about $100<sup>2</sup>. When an account is upgraded, the $100 upgrade fee is divided
among the registrar and referrer and the account *becomes its own referrer*. When an account is
its own referrer it gets 80% cash back on every transaction fee it pays.

### Example

Let's look at an example of how this system works in practice. Sam learns about BitShares after a
Google search for "decentralized exchange" and decides to create an account. He chooses a hosted
wallet provider such as [moonstone.io](http://moonstone.io) to create an account. Moonstone has already become a lifetime
member, so when Moonstone creates an account for Sam it sets the registrar and referrer to
Moonstone's account.

After trying out BitShares, Sam decides that he likes it and would probably save money in the
long-run by becoming a lifetime member and collecting 80% cash back on all of his transaction
fees. When he upgrades, he pays a $100 upgrade fee which is divided between the BitShares network (20%)
and Moonstone (80%).

At this point Moonstone notifies Sam that he can participate in their affiliate program. Anytime
a new user referred by Sam creates an account, Moonstone will share the referral income
with Sam. The amount that Moonstone shares with its affiliates is entirely at the discretion of
Moonstone, but for this example we will assume a 50/50 split.

Sam likes the deal and refers Moonstone to his friend Alice. Alice creates an account with
Moonstone and Moonstone is set as the registrar while Sam is set as the referrer earning 40%
of every transaction fee paid by Alice. If Alice ultimately decides to become a lifetime member
herself, then her $100 upgrade fee would be divided among the BitShares network ($20),
Moonstone ($40) and Sam ($40).
