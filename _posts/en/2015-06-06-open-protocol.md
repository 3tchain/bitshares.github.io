title: Open Protocol, Transparent Code
---

--------
BitShares is first and foremost a protocol based upon a public ledger.  Anyone may provide and distribute
an alternative implementation of the protocol and use the protocol for any other blockchain.  The [Graphene
Toolkit produced by Cryptonomex, Inc](http://cryptonomex.com) is only one possible implementation of the protocol.

The Graphene Toolkit has been licensed by Cryptonomex, Inc for use with the BitShares (BTS) blockchain.   
The terms of the license allow the Graphene Toolkit and any derivatives thereof to be used with the BitShares 
blockchain without any restrictions.  Cryptonomex, Inc retains all rights to the Graphene Toolkit and any 
derivatives thereof for any other use.  The BitShares blockchain is defined as exactly one global ledger. In the
event of a hard-fork only one branch may be considered the official BitShares ledger which will be unambiguously
decided as the fork with the highest market capitalization.

This means that from the perspective of BitShares, the Graphene Toolkit is fully open source and its use, 
distribution, and future cannot be dictated by Cryptonomex or any other entity. 

## Rationale 

Crypto currencies and financial markets depend heavily upon network effect.  Keeping the technology restricted
helps defend the network effect gained by BitShares from those that would copy the technology, reallocate ownership,
and then compete for network effect.

BitShares benefits from gaining free access to all public derivatives of the Graphene Toolkit and having the cost of
advancing the technology subsidized by Cryptonomex, Inc.
