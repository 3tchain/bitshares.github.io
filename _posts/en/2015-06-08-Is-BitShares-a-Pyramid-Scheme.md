title: Is BitShares a Pyramid Scheme?
---

Many people may mistakenly jump to the conclusion that BitShares is a Pyramid Scheme.   We have gone to great lengths to ensure that it is a legitimate and sustainable model.  Before reviewing the SEC's 
advice regarding detecting Pyramid Schemes lets clear up some common misconceptions.

## BitShares is not a Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) system.  

There is only 1 level, though there are several classes in that single layer.  Each account splits its fee among several users (registerar, referring subscriber, referring member, and the network).  These users are all at the
same level.  When an account upgrades to a subscriber or lifetime member it becomes its own "referring subscriber", "registrar",  and/or "referring member" which prevents the pyramid from forming.

## Becoming a Subscriber or Member has value independent of Referrals 

Any user who expects to pay more transaction fees than the average user can save money by upgrading their account even if the referral program didn't exist. 

## How the SEC Defines a Pyramid Scheme

In the classic "pyramid" scheme, participants attempt to make money solely by recruiting new participants into the program. The hallmark of these schemes is the promise of sky-high returns in a short period of time for doing nothing other than handing over your money and getting others to do the same.

The fraudsters behind a pyramid scheme may go to great lengths to make the program look like a legitimate multi-level marketing program. But despite their claims to have legitimate products or services to sell, these fraudsters simply use money coming in from new recruits to pay off early stage investors. But eventually the pyramid will collapse. At some point the schemes get too big, the promoter cannot raise enough money from new investors to pay earlier investors, and many people lose their money. The chart below shows how pyramid schemes can become impossible to sustain:

The SEC has [posted advice](http://www.sec.gov/enforce/investor-alerts-bulletins/investoralertsia_pyramidhtm.html) on how to identify a legitimate marketing promotion from a fraudulent pyramid scam.  

When considering joining an MLM program, beware of these hallmarks of a pyramid scheme:

## No genuine product or service. 

MLM programs involve selling a genuine product or service to people who are not in the program. Exercise caution if there is no underlying product or service being sold to others, or if what is being sold is speculative or appears inappropriately priced.

BitShares has offered a genuine service based upon transaction fees for over 1 year and has an entire class of users who are outside of the referral system. 

## Promises of high returns in a short time period

Be leery of pitches for exponential returns and "get rich quick" claims. High returns and fast cash in an MLM program may suggest that commissions are being paid out of money from new recruits rather than revenue generated by product sales.

Under BitShare all referral income vests over 12 months.  During the growth phase income may be mostly from signing up new users, but ultimately the primary motivation for becoming a subscriber or lifetime member should be the personal savings.


## Easy money or passive income

Be wary if you are offered compensation in exchange for little work such as making payments, recruiting others, and placing advertisements.

The BitShares referral program has the potential to generate passive income, but is designed to encourage most users to become lifetime members which ends up cutting off the passive income streams.   


## No demonstrated revenue from retail sales

Ask to see documents, such as financial statements audited by a certified public accountant (CPA), showing that the MLM company generates revenue from selling its products or services to people outside the program.

BitShares is fully transparent and has demonstrated revenue from transaction fees for over 1 year. 

## Buy-in required
The goal of an MLM program is to sell products. Be careful if you are required to pay a buy-in to participate in the program, even if the buy-in is a nominal one-time or recurring fee (e.g., $10 or $10/month).

BitShares does require users to buy-in, but in reality it is more of a “buy out”.  Users effectively buy the right to their own referral stream from their referrer.   This is a necessary requirement to prevent scamming the referral program.  


## Complex commission structure
Be concerned unless commissions are based on products or services that you or your recruits sell to people outside the program. If you do not understand how you will be compensated, be cautious.

Like always, be sure to understand the value BitShares provides to you.  You should only become a subscriber or member if you expect you will save more from your own discounts than you paid to subscribe.  


## Emphasis on recruiting
If a program primarily focuses on recruiting others to join the program for a fee, it is likely a pyramid scheme. Be skeptical if you will receive more compensation for recruiting others than for product sales.

The point of the BitShares referral program is to recruit users to join a financial ecosystem.  Our goal is for this ecosystem to have tremendous value to the users as a faster, cheaper, and more honest financial platform.   Early on the lack of network effect means there are fewer merchants, traders, etc using the platform and therefore most revenue will come from recruiting new users.   As the system matures most users will choose to upgrade because it is cheaper to become a member than pay as you go.
