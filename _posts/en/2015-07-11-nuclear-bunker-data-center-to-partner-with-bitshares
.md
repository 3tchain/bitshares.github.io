Jonathan Baha’i, President of Data Security Node, explains, *“We have come to a place, technologically, where a revolution is about to happen at all levels of society - thanks to a new breed of blockchain driven technologies. [BitShares 2.0](https://bitshares.org/blog/2015/06/08/announcing-bitshares-2.0/) is at the crest of this movement, and we are absolutely thrilled to be joining forces with them.”*

The new partnership comes by way of a service offering from DSN called BunkerDEX which enables the exchange of crypto assets between multiple blockchains. Through the BitShares network, customers will be able to exchange virtual assets of all kinds, from popular crypto currencies like Bitcoin, to [SmartCoins](https://bitshares.org/technology/price-stable-cryptocurrencies/) that hold the value of Dollars and Euro, to alternative banking solutions like bill and payment services that provide lower fees and less risk than most brick-and-mortar banks.

*“BunkerDEX will be the foundation for several offerings that connect to services from our bunker,” Jonathan continues “such as BunkerMining, The Canadian Rewards Debit, and S.A.F.E. (Synchronized Asset Futures Engine). We have some pretty amazing tools to work with now, thanks to the BitShares 2.0 platform.”*

*“Our nuclear bunker data center is the perfect place to host critical data, like financial transactions, that need a high level of protection.”* says Jonathan,  *“Most of us don’t expect nukes to fall from the sky any time soon, but the increasing appearance of natural disasters is actually a huge threat to data centers all around the world. Even data centers with sophisticated contingency planning have shown that they are helpless in the face of large scale natural disasters. For example, an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP), either manmade or by solar flares, would instantly destroy the electronics in most data centers. Due to the sophisticated construction of our bunker, we are the only solution in Canada that provides protection from these types of threats.”*
