title: TL;DR; -- Clarifying Some Aspects Raised by the Community
---

Prior to the announcement the BitShares community has been asked to collect a set of their concerns that should be
answered together with the announcement right away. Here we go:

1. How fast is BitShares 2.0 "really" (in TPS)?

   BitShares 2.0 will be capable of handling over 100.000 (100k) transaction per second on commodity hardware with
   parallel architectural optimizations in mind.

2. Will we see 'voted' hard forks?

   Yes. In BitShares 2.0, not even the Core Developers will be able to modify the protocol at will. Hard forks will only
   be accepted by the protocol on shareholder approval.

3. Will there be a referral system available at launch?

   Yes. Absolutely. And you can earn up to $80\* per user (per lifetime) referred.

4. Are Turing complete scripts/applications on the roadmap?

   ??????????????????????

5. Will the separated Worker/Delegate/Signer proposal be implemented in time?

   Yes. In BitShares 2.0 we will see workers, who grow and development the ecosystem, block signers (called witnesses)
   to ensure blockchain security, and delegates which define (after shareholder proposal), the variable settings of the
   blockchain, such as, block interval, price feeds, and more.

6. What has been done to stabilize the user interface and make it user friendly/more responsive?

   A lot has been done to this regard. Mainly, the full client has been separated into a lightweight client which
   connects to a set of trusted servers, and an optional core client that handles the full blockchain and P2P
   networking. Furthermore, the lightweight client has been rewritten to employ next generation web technologies
   (websockets, react.js,...) to ensure a highly responsive interface.

7. Can we expect a fast, professional GUI experience within this year?

   Absolutely!

8. Will the new client be more resource efficient?

   In BitShares 2.0, communications with the core client are handled with the websockets protocol. Thus the core client
   could be either run on a separated machine, or by some else entirely on a trust-less basis. The BitShares network
   will be entirely accessible via web browser, either hosted locally or by a third party service provider similar to
   blockchain.info (with private keys being stored locally only!).

9. Have there been any ideas to increase voting participation (e.g. cold storage voting, simplified voting procedure)

   Besides cold storage voting which will be available in BitShares 2.0 too, the blockchain supports transfer of voting
   power to someone else without risking funds. Furthermore, with BitShares 2.0 the BitShares funds do not need to be
   moved entirely to vote with your full stake, which simplifies the voting process to a single "Apply" button press.

10. What can be done to against whales dominating the voting process?

    ?????????????????????

12. What's the core product and how do shareholders profit from it?

    ?????????????????????

13. Will we see relative orders?

    ?????????????????????

14. Assuming there will not be two different bitUSD, how will the switch from bitasset 1.0 to bitasset 2.0 look like?
15. Will we be able to close short orders using the collateral?

    ?????????????????????

16. How can KYC and AML be acknowledge in BitShares such that it does not affect BTS holders?

    ?????????????????????

17. Will there be any big exchanges/banks who issue their assets on the BitShares blockchain?

    ?????????????????????

11. What has been done to attract more 3rd party developers?

    - gitlab.bitshares.org?
    ?????????????????????

18. What measures have been taken to ensure that newly written code does not introduced many bugs or reveal hidden
    design assumptions that are no longer valid?

    ?????????????????????
