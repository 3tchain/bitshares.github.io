During the last several months, the Bitshares share price has dropped, making it unable to support the core dev team via delegate pay. Thanks to their commitment to the vision, many core devs were able to stay on the project by selling their purchased bitshares and delegate pay. For a number of devs, their bitshares savings are nearly exhausted as well. This is not a desirable or fair scenario, but a solution has been found.

On their own dime, and under the business name Cryptonomex Inc., the core dev team has created an open source blockchain toolkit called Graphene. Why should the bitshares community care? For three very important reasons.

1.     The core dev team is making the Graphene toolkit available for the bitshares community to use royalty free, and without restriction, if the bitshares community votes to use it.
2.     In contrast, any other party looking to use the toolkit in an open project will only receive such permission if they honor a 20% airdrop on the bitshares community.
3.     The Graphene toolkit has many uses in private, closed-source organizations. In exchange for a royalty fee paid to Cryptonomex Inc, organizations can use the Graphene toolkit for their closed-source implementation. Although no guarantees can be made as to the future revenue streams from this outlet, we believe that, over time, this income can sustain Cryptonomex Inc., in maintaining and advancing the Graphene toolkit, and reduce or possibly even eliminate the current reliance on bitshares dilution.
