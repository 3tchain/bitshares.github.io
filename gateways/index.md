# Gateways

There are many ways to move funds into or out of the BitShares ecosystem.

## Gateways

Gateways are the recommended method of moving funds into or out of the network. They offer
fiat<->bitAsset pairs such that you can trade bitUSD:USD.

- BlockTrades
- CCEDK.com

## Bridges

Bridges simplify the process of moving funds from one blockchain-based crypto currency to another.
For instance, you can buy bitUSD with Bitcoin at (close to) market rates quickly. Most trusted
services are:

- MetaExchange.info
- BlockTrades.us
- Shapeshift.io
- TradeBTS.com

## Exchanges

Most crypto-currency exchanges offer a wide variety of different crypto currency pairs and in
contrast to bridges not only allow for instant trades at market price, but also offer to put a
buy/sell order at a desired price.
