priority: 1
summary: >
    BitShares has an advanced referral program built into the software.  Financial networks derive their value mostly
    from their network effect.  The more people that use the same network the more value that network has to the users.
    BitShares rewards those who sign up new users that actually use the network and does so in a fully transparent and
    automated way.

## Promoting Infrastructure Development

The [BitShares Referral Program](/referral-program/) is designed to promote infrastructure development.
All decentralized financial networks depend upon many business partners to build an ecosystem.  This means motivating
entrepreneurs to build businesses such as Exchanges, Merchant Services, Hosted Wallets, Light Weight Wallets, and Block
Explorers around the network.   With the BitShares referral program, merchants can now earn significantly more by
advertising their support for the BitShares platform.  Whereas other platforms can only offer "lower fees", BitShares
offers merchants a revenue stream.

Free market competition will result in many different hosted wallet providers competing to acquire new users.   Each of
these providers will have financial incentive to advertise their wallets by traditional means which in turn will result
in increasing network effect for BitShares.

## Background - PayPal's Referral System

Bootstrapping a new financial network is very hard and is often a [chicken or the
egg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg) problem.  It is difficult to attract new users because new users
will only join if there are existing users.

To overcome this problem we looked at what companies like PayPal did to reach critical mass.

> <i>PayPal’s big challenge was to get new customers. They tried advertising. It was too expensive. They tried Business
> Development (BD) deals with big banks. Bureaucratic hilarity ensued.  The PayPal team reached an important conclusion:
> BD didn’t work. They needed organic, viral growth. They needed to give people money.</i>

> <i> So that’s what they did. New customers got $10 for signing up, and existing ones got $10 for referrals. Growth
> went exponential, and PayPal wound up paying $20 for each new customer. It felt like things were working and not
> working at the same time; 7 to 10% daily growth and 100 million users was good. No revenues and an exponentially
> growing cost structure were not. Things felt a little unstable. PayPal needed buzz so it could raise more capital and
> continue on.</i>

Giving people money is both expensive and potentially unsustainable, but it has been proven to work.

## Cost of Customer Acquisition vs Lifetime Value of Customer

BitShares recognizes that a sustainable system must be able to cover all operating expenses from cash flow.  In the
article ["Startup Killer: the Cost of Customer Acquisition"](http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/startup-killer/), David
Skok shared the lessons he learned after watching several hundred startups that had failed.

<i>However after closely watching several hundred startups that have failed, I observed that a very large number of
these had solved the product/market fit problem, but still failed because they had not found a way to acquire customers
at a low enough cost.</i>

A well balanced business model must have a cost of user acquisition that is much lower than the businesses ability to
monetize its customers.

In the case of BitShares this means setting transaction fees that are high enough to cover all costs, including the cost
of customer acquisition, while still being low enough to compete against real competitors.  Most crypto-currency
networks barely charge enough in transaction fees to cover the cost of running the network.  They attempt to attract
users with low fees.  While low fees are important, undervaluing the service provided is counter productive.  For this
reason BitShares charges a price that is much higher than competing crypto-currencies but much lower than traditional
exchanges and payment networks like Dwolla or PayPal.

To ensure the cost of customer acquisition is sustainable, the BitShares referral system is designed to always payout a
*percentage of **actual profits** *.   BitShares allows the users to draw their own conclusions about the Life Time
Value(LTV) of each customer they refer after educating them about the LTV of customers for similar businesses.   We
believe that the BitShares network can offer each referrer an average value of $80 per member they sign up, or $40
dollars if they go through an affiliate.  This value is realized over time based upon the actual usage of the customers.
Even if a customer thinks we are over estimating by a factor of 4, BitShares is still offering a larger incentive than
PayPal did.

## Conclusion

BitShares is built for viral growth and has industry leading incentives that are game changing.
