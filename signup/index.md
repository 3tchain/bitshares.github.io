Getting started with BitShares is easy!
This tutorial will walk you through the process of getting a fully functional registered account on the BitShares blockchain.

    Step 1 - Download Software
    Step 2 - Create Account
    Step 3 - Register Account
    Step 4 - Backup Wallet

Step 1 - Download Software
The first step is to Download BitShares client and install the software.
BitShares Client

x32-bit/64-bit
BitShares Client

Mavericks
BitShares Client

Linux 64-bit

After you have downloaded the latest version for your computer and installed the BitShares application, start it up and accept the license. You should then be presented with a screen asking you to set your wallet password.

Step 1 - Download Software

Your password is used to protect your wallet, which contains your private keys while they are stored on your computer. Be sure to use a reasonably strong password and that your password is not used anywhere else.

NOTE: Do not assume that if you remember your password that you can recover your funds from another computer just because it has BitShares installed. We will walk you through the process of backing up your wallet in a later step.
Step 2 - Create an Account
The next step is to create an account where you should be presented with a screen similar to the screen shown below:

Step 2 - Create an Account

Once you have chosen an account name that you are happy with, click the Create New Account button.

NOTE: An account is a named public key that allows you to receive funds, login to websites, and sign messages. A wallet can contain one or more accounts, which means that you can create multiple accounts within your wallet, so there’s no need to worry about picking the perfect name.

After clicking Create New Account you will have what is known as an unregistered account, as shown below:

Step 2 - Account created

NOTE: An unregistered account is like an unlisted phone number. No one knows about it unless you share the Account Key with them and they manually add it as a contact.
Step 3 - Register Account
The next step is to register an account by clicking the blue button
to the right of your account name.

This will bring up a dialog that asks you how you would like to pay the transaction fee required to register your newly created account:

Register Account

NOTE: Because this is your first account and you have no funds, you are given an option for the BitShares faucet to pay your transaction fee on your behalf.

Now, click the blue Register button, which will open your web browser and take you to faucet.bitshares

Register Account

Once you’ve reached faucet.bitshares.org, you will be asked to login via one of several different services that most people already have an account with:

Faucet

NOTE: This is done to prevent abuse of the free faucet registration service only. Your BitShares account is not publicly tied to the service you choose to login with.

After logging in via one of these services, the faucet gives you an opportunity to share your new account with your friends, if you like:

Faucet complete

NOTE: Regardless of whether or not you chose to share your new account, your account will automatically and instantly be registered on the blockchain.

When you return to your wallet, your account should be shown as a Registered account:

Account registered

Welcome to the blockchain! Reaching this step means you have successfully created and registered your account with the blockchain and may now use it to receive funds. If you run into any problems following the steps above, there are very helpful people on the BitShares forum who will be more than willing to help!
